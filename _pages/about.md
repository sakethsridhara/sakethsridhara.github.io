I am a PhD student at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by  Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan) at the [Engineering Representations and Simulation Lab].(https://ersl.wisc.edu/) 

I believe that the use of optimization and machine learning techniques can not only improve the design of products, but also offer valuable understanding and insights to engineers and practitioners.
