I am a PhD student at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by  Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan) at the [Engineering Representations and Simulation Lab](https://ersl.wisc.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of engineering design, machine learning, and topology optimization. I have developed a novel approach for representing engineering materials and catalogs using neural networks (autoencoders) which enables visualization, optimal selection and customization. Additionally, I have explored using implicit neural networks for geometric representation and automatic differentiation in the design of microstructures and designs that span multiple scales via topology optimization. 

I believe that utilizing optimization techniques and machine learning can not only enhance engineering design, but also provide valuable understanding and insights for engineers and practitioners.
