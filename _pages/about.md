I am a PhD student at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by  Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan) at the [Engineering Representations and Simulation Lab](https://ersl.wisc.edu/) 

My research lies at the intersection of engineering design, machine learning, and optimization. I have created a novel approach for representing engineering materials and catalogs using neural networks which enables visualization, optimal selection and customization. Additionally, I have explored using neural networks for geometric representation and automatic differentiation in the design of microstructures and designs that span multiple scales. 

I believe that the use of optimization methods and machine learning techniques can not only improve the design of products, but also offer valuable understanding and insights to engineers and practitioners.
