I am a PhD student at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by  Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan) at the [Engineering Representations and Simulation Lab].(https://ersl.wisc.edu/) 

My research lies at the intersection of engineering design, machine learning, and optimization. I have created a novel approach for representing engineering materials and catalogs using neural networks. Additionally, I have explored using neural network representation and automated differentiation for the design of microstructures and designs that span multiple scales. Find additional information about my work by viewing the publications and talks sections.

I believe that the use of optimization and machine learning techniques can not only improve the design of products, but also offer valuable understanding and insights to engineers and practitioners.
