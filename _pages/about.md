[comment]: <fifth year PhD student at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by  Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan) at the [Engineering Representations and Simulation Lab](https://ersl.wisc.edu/), majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Sciences.

My research interests include engineering design optimization, numerical methods for PDEs, and machine learning. Recently, I developed a novel approach for representing engineering materials and catalogs using neural networks (autoencoders) enabling visualization, optimal selection, and customization. Additionally, I have explored using implicit neural networks for geometric representation and automatic differentiation in the design of microstructures and designs that span multiple scales via topology optimization. 

I believe that the integration of optimization techniques and machine learning can not only elevate engineering design but also inform engineers and practitioners with invaluable understanding and insights.

You can find more details about my work by checking the publications and talks tabs, and my contact details on the sidebar. I'd love to connect!>
